# ðŸŒŒ LIGO Gravitational Wave Analysis Toolkit (Colab)

This project is a Colab-powered framework for analyzing gravitational wave data from the LIGO Open Science Center. It features modular analyzers that span from standard signal processing to speculative quantum-coherence and cosmological pattern discovery.

> ðŸ”„ Designed for physicists, artists, and rogue theorists exploring the structure behind the waveform.

```python
pipeline = LIGODataPipeline()
data = pipeline.fetch_event_data('GW150914')

analyzer = WaveAnalyzer(data)
filtered = analyzer.bandpass_filter()

qmem = QuantumMemoryAnalyzer(filtered)
coh_stats = qmem.analyze_quantum_coherence()
```
